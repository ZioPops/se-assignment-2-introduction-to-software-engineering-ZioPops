# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:

It's the process dealing with designing, developing, maintaining etc., of software apps. 

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?

Software engineering is the process dealing with designing, developing, maintaining etc., of software apps.
It differs from traditional programming in that the latter focuses mainly on the code aspect while the former deals with the whole life span of software apps.

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Planning - define the goal/objective of developing the software
Analysis - brainstorm on what it will entail
Designing - shaping it by putting thoughts together and laying out a structure
Development - putting the thoughts into code
Testing - seeing if the code works and debugging where necessary
Deployment - Putting the software out there to be used
Maintenance - Updating and fixing it from time to time

Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?



Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.

It's the process of defining, documenting, and maintaining requirements in the engineering design process.
It is a critical process in software engineering that involves identifying, analyzing, documenting, and managing the requirements of a software system.
Elicitation - gathering requirements from the target audience to identify the desired features.
Analysis - assessing the requirements for feasibility and solving any problems.
Specification - documenting the requirements lucidly.
Validation - reviewing and validating the requirements to ensure they meet the target audience's needs.
Management - managing the requirements throughout the lifecycle while noting the changes.
It ensures that the software meets the requirements of the target audience.

Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?

Modularity creates software making sure to minimize its dependency on a system's components. 
Maintainability - It's easier to identify and fix bugs keeping the other parts of the system safe since a change in one module doesn't affect the rest. 
Scalability - Modular systems can be easily expanded by incorporating new modules or upgrading existing ones without affecting the rest of the system.

Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?

Unit testing - its code that checks whether another smaller piece of code works correctly.
Integration testing - testing the different components of a software as one combined block. 
System testing - testing every part of a software to ensure it works correctly as a whole.
Acceptance testing - the last test that checks whether the end-product satisfies the user's expectations.
Testing is crucial because it ensures the software works well and is fit for the market and the end-user.

Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.

They are software systems/tools that assist to manage changes to code. 
They help to have multiple people collaborate on the same project, keep the history of the changes made to the code, create branches enabling developers to work on different parts of the code in isolation of the main code etc.
Examples: Git, Subversion, Mercurial, SVN etc.

Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?

A software project manager serves as the contact between developers and stakeholders.
Responsibilities: risk management, prohect planning, team management, resource allocation, etc.
Challenges: accountability, unaccomodating deadlines, communication issues, resource allocations, etc. 

Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?

It's the process of updating or modifying software to meet the needs of the client.
Types: adaptive, preventive,corrective, perfective
It's essential because software often gets outdated or develops problems and therefore needs to be maintained.  

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?

Algorithmic bias, dishonesty, lack of accountability, unethical data collection, etc.
By ensuring that their software id dependable and that they themselves are upright people.

Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
Submit your completed assignment by [due date].
